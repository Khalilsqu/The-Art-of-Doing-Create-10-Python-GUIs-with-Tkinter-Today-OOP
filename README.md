# The-Art-of-Doing-Create-10-Python-GUIs-with-Tkinter-Today-OOP

This is the same repo as this [repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Art-of-Doing-Create-10-Python-GUIs-with-Tkinter-Today) but in OOP way. I was practicing tkinter and thought the material available in the original repo would be great.
